  title: Advocate and advocate clerk registry
  description: |
    This document houses API specifications to register court system users - advocate, advocate clerk etc.. This registry sits on top of the base user/individual registries. All users will be registered in the DIGIT individual/user registries with mobile number, name and other basic fields. This registry only stores extra information as needed for dispute resolution systems. While this is a very basic registry currently, this can evolve into a very detailed registry in future versions. Verification of advocate/clerk credentials is left to the implementation.
