  title: Case Management Service
  description: |
    This is a draft API specification for a case management service that provides value added services on top of the Case registry. 
    1. The case management service provides APIs to retrieve the summary and history of a case. 
    2. It updates the master status of the case by looking into the status of all the different entities in the case lifecycle. This is done as per the case classification strategy that was agreed upon. 
    3. The service also provides a way to group/ungroup cases

      summary: API to get next valid number from case
      description: |
        A case has multiple different types of numbers like filing number, CMP number, CNR number and CC/ST number. Each of these has its own format, its own sequencing and its uniqueness range. All of these numbers are owned by the Case Registry. 

        There is a need for applications raised against a case use the same CMP numbering series that the case uses and hence this API is to get the next valid CMP number. 

        NOTE-- If more entities like order, hearing or if other sequences like that of CNR or CC/ST number need to be shared as well, then, it would be worthwhile to make a separate registry and service for Numbers.
